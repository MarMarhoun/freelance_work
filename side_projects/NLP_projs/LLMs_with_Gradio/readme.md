# AI web app using Gradio

## Project description:

In this notebook, I will try to create a web app using [Gradio](https://www.gradio.app/). Most of the code was inspired by this [tutorial](https://learn.deeplearning.ai/huggingface-gradio), namely 'Building Generative AI Applications with Gradio'.
