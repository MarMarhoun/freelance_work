# AI web app using Gradio

## Project description:

In this notebook, I will try to create a web app using [Gradio](https://www.gradio.app/). Most of the code was inspired by this [tutorial](https://learn.deeplearning.ai/huggingface-gradio), namely 'Building Generative AI Applications with Gradio'.

# Web app for image captioning and image generation using Gradio, LLM models

## Project description:

To create a web application for image captioning and image generation using Gradio, Hugging Face's models, and an online dataset, we can break down the task into several steps. Below is a structured approach to implement this functionality.

# Medical Image Segmentation: for X-ray and MRI Analysis

To create an advanced image segmentation application using Gradio and Large Language Models (LLMs) from Hugging Face, we can follow these steps. The application will take an input image (such as an X-ray or MRI scan) from a URL, use a model to generate a segmentation mask, and then display both the mask and the segmented image.
