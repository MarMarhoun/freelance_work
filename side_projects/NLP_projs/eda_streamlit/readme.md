# Projects using the Streamlit, Gradio & Flask frameworks 

## Basic EDA and the word cloud using streamlit 

The **app.py** file contains a basic EDA and the word cloud using streamlit library.
By running the above code in a Streamlit environment, you can perform basic EDA and visualize word clouds for your custom dataset. Remember to replace 'your_file.csv' with the path to your actual file.


## Projects using the Streamlit, Gradio & Flask frameworks 

The **EDA_streamlit.ipynb** file contains several tasks for various tools but mostly using Streamlit framework.

## Sentiment analysis task using deep learning and the xai for interpretation and deploy it using streamlit, Gradio and tensorflow

The **ml_streamlit.ipynb** file describes how you can train a multiclassification task using PyTorch and then deploy the model using Gradio. First, let's start with training the model. We will use the FashionMNIST dataset, which is a dataset of 60,000 28x28 grayscale images of 10 fashion categories, along with a test set of 10,000 images. We will use a simple convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture for this task.
