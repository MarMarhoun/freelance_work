# Projects using the Streamlit, Gradio & Flask frameworks 

## Basic EDA and the word cloud using streamlit 

The **app.py** file contains a basic EDA and the word cloud using streamlit library.
By running the above code in a Streamlit environment, you can perform basic EDA and visualize word clouds for your custom dataset. Remember to replace 'your_file.csv' with the path to your actual file.


## Projects using the Streamlit, Gradio & Flask frameworks 

The **EDA_streamlit.ipynb** file contains several tasks for various tools but mostly using Streamlit framework.

## Sentiment analysis task using deep learning and the xai for interpretation and deploy it using streamlit, Gradio and tensorflow

The **ml_streamlit.ipynb** file describes how you can train a multiclassification task using PyTorch and then deploy the model using Gradio. First, let's start with training the model. We will use the FashionMNIST dataset, which is a dataset of 60,000 28x28 grayscale images of 10 fashion categories, along with a test set of 10,000 images. We will use a simple convolutional neural network (CNN) architecture for this task. 

## Medical images segmentation using deep learning model and streamlit and TensorFlow

This example demonstrates how to train a deep learning model for medical image segmentation using TensorFlow and the U-Net architecture, and how to deploy it using Streamlit. Note that you may need to adjust the code to fit your specific use case and dataset. Implement a more sophisticated data augmentation pipeline using Albumentations. Use a learning rate scheduler to adjust the learning rate during training. Add a callback to save the best model based on validation loss. Implement a sliding window approach for inference on high-resolution images.

## Web App to deploy a resume parser model using streamlit

The **resume_parser.ipynb** # Project Description:

To create a web app to deploy a resume parser model using Streamlit, you need to have the following:

A trained resume parser model (e.g., using Named Entity Recognition or Information Extraction techniques)
Streamlit library installed in your Python environment.
