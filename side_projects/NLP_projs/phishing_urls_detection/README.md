# Phishing URLs detection using PhishStorm dataset & SVM, XGBoost and Random Forest algorithms.

## Project Description:

Phishing is a form of fraud in which the attacker tries to learn sensitive information such as login credentials or account information by sending as a reputable entity or person in email or other communication channels.

Typically a victim receives a message that appears to have been sent by a known contact or organization. The message contains malicious software targeting the userâ€™s computer or has links to direct victims to malicious websites in order to trick them into divulging personal and financial information, such as passwords, account IDs or credit card details.

## Dataset Description:

URLs dataset with features built and used for evaluation in the paper "[PhishStorm](https://research.aalto.fi/en/datasets/phishstorm-phishing-legitimate-url-dataset): Detecting Phishing with Streaming Analytics" published in IEEE TNSM.
The dataset contains 96,018 URLs: 48,009 legitimate URLs and 48,009 phishing URLs.

This is a CSV file where the "domain" column provides a unique identifier for each entry (which is actually a URL). The "label" column provides the domain entry status, 0: legitimate / 1:phishing.
