# Simple Python challenge


*Make sure you extract the zip archive first

This is a simple Python challenge created to make sure you're comfortable making changes to existing Python code-bases

Inside this project, you'll find a simple Python-based calculator.
It has all the typical functions you'd expect out of a calculator to perform various arithmetic

Step 1)

Run the calculator by opening a command window and going into the 'Lloyds Simple Calculator Project-V4_2023' folder,
and then run 'python calculator.py' or 'python3 calculator.py' or by double clicking calculator.py and 
opening it with Python

*Please note, you may need to run 'pip install tkinter' and 'pip install requests' to load the calculators GUI

Familiarize yourself with the functions available through the calculators GUI before making changes to the code

Step 2)

Implement the following changes to the code-base

- Change the overall theme of the Calculator (colour, button shapes)
- Implement any scientific calculator function of choice


Once you've completed the tasks, zip up the project folder and send it back to Lorraine via email
