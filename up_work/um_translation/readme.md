# Fine-tune the T5-small model specifically for the Urdu-to-English translation task

We are seeking a skilled machine learning engineer to fine-tune the T5-small transformer model for an Urdu-to-English translation task. The T5-small model, developed by Google, is an encoder-decoder transformer architecture with 60 million parameters, designed for various text generation tasks.

Responsibilities: Fine-tune the T5-small model specifically for the Urdu-to-English translation task. Utilize the dataset provided by the Kaggle competition: Urdu-to-English NMT Using T5-Small. 

Optimize the model for accuracy and performance. Evaluate and validate the model's performance using appropriate metrics. Document the fine-tuning process and provide detailed reports on the model's performance.

Requirements: Proven experience with transformer models, particularly T5. Proficiency in Python and deep learning frameworks such as TensorFlow or PyTorch. Experience with natural language processing (NLP) tasks, especially in machine translation. Familiarity with Hugging Face's Transformers library. Ability to work with large datasets and manage data preprocessing. Strong problem-solving skills and attention to detail.

Preferred Qualifications: Previous experience in fine-tuning transformer models for translation tasks. Familiarity with the Urdu language. Experience with Kaggle competitions.
